# Tweet Saver 

Tweet Saver adds a button to every post on X that saves the post. Each saved post is accessible in the extension icon.

I made this extension to help make bookmarking tweets annd returning to previously viewed posts more accesible when switching between accounts. 

## Installation
- Download the extension folder and load it as unpacked in your Chrome based browser (Chrome, Brave, Chromium). For anyone who wants to use it on Firefox, let me know and I'll help you install it.

It's not yet published to the Chrome Web Store. Tweet Saver started as a personal project to make browsing X easier. If there's enough demand I'll make a production version ASAP.
